## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-16

### ðŸŽ‰ Monorepo Transformation: Multi-IDE Platform

This release transforms aws-jupyter into AWS IDE, a monorepo supporting multiple cloud-based IDE types.

### Major Changes

#### **Monorepo Architecture**
- Transformed single-app project into Go workspace monorepo
- Created `pkg/` module for shared AWS infrastructure
- Created `apps/jupyter/` with complete aws-jupyter implementation
- Created `apps/rstudio/` with basic aws-rstudio implementation
- All apps share infrastructure while maintaining independence

#### **Code Organization**
- **Shared library (`pkg/`)**: AWS SDK integrations, CLI utilities, configuration
- **App-specific code (`apps/*/`)**: IDE-specific logic, environments, user data
- **Go workspace**: Proper module boundaries with `go.work`
- **Clean separation**: No code duplication between apps

#### **Build & CI/CD**
- Updated CI/CD pipeline for monorepo structure
- Matrix builds for pkg, jupyter, and rstudio modules
- Separate test, lint, and build jobs for each component
- All builds and tests passing

#### **Documentation**
- Updated root README for multi-IDE overview
- Created comprehensive RStudio README
- Updated ROADMAP for multi-IDE roadmap (v0.5.0-v1.0.0)
- Consolidated docs into app-specific directories
- Removed duplicate documentation

#### **aws-rstudio (New)**
- Basic implementation with core commands
- Shares all infrastructure with Jupyter
- Supports launch, list, status, connect, stop, terminate
- SSH and Session Manager connection methods
- Public/private subnet support
- Feature parity work in progress (see ROADMAP)

### Added
- **aws-rstudio CLI**: New command-line tool for RStudio Server
- **Shared pkg/ library**: Reusable AWS infrastructure code
- **Go workspace**: Multi-module project structure
- **Monorepo CI/CD**: Matrix builds for all modules
- **RStudio README**: Complete documentation for RStudio launcher

### Changed
- **Project name**: aws-jupyter â†’ AWS IDE (aws-ide)
- **Repository structure**: Single app â†’ Monorepo
- **Code location**: `internal/` â†’ `pkg/` (shared) and `apps/*/internal/` (app-specific)
- **Documentation**: Root docs â†’ `apps/*/docs/`
- **Build process**: Single binary â†’ Multiple app binaries
- **Version strategy**: Shared version across all apps

### Fixed
- Test failures in apps/jupyter/internal/cli/launch_test.go (function signature mismatches)
- Build artifacts not ignored by git
- CI/CD pipeline incompatible with workspace structure

### Removed
- Legacy `internal/` directory (moved to `pkg/`)
- Legacy `cmd/` directory (moved to `apps/*/cmd/`)
- Root-level `go.mod` and `go.sum` (using `go.work` instead)
- Duplicate documentation in root `docs/` directory

### Migration Notes

**For Existing Users:**
- `aws-jupyter` functionality unchanged - all features preserved
- Binary location changed: `./aws-jupyter` â†’ `./apps/jupyter/aws-jupyter`
- Install path unchanged: `/usr/local/bin/aws-jupyter`
- Configuration compatible: `~/.aws-jupyter/` still used
- State files compatible: No migration needed

**For Developers:**
- Update imports: `github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-jupyter/internal/...` â†’ `github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-ide/pkg/...`
- Build from app directory: `cd apps/jupyter && go build ./cmd/aws-jupyter`
- Run tests per module: `cd pkg && go test ./...` or `cd apps/jupyter && go test ./...`
- CI/CD uses matrix builds for each module

### Metrics
- **Modules**: 3 (pkg, jupyter, rstudio)
- **Test Coverage**: 18.7% overall (unchanged)
- **Build Status**: All modules building successfully
- **Binary Size**: ~44MB per app
- **IDE Support**: 2 types (Jupyter Lab, RStudio Server)

### Looking Forward

This monorepo transformation enables:
- Easy addition of new IDE types (VSCode, JupyterHub, etc.)
- Shared infrastructure reduces duplication
- Consistent behavior across all IDE types
- Independent versioning possible in future

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for v0.5.0-v1.0.0 planning.
