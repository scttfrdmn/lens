# AWS IDE Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for the AWS IDE project. The project follows semantic versioning and is organized into phases.

## üìä Current Status: Monorepo Established

**Project Evolution:**
- ‚úÖ **v0.1.0-v0.4.0**: aws-jupyter (single app) - Feature complete
- ‚úÖ **Monorepo Migration**: Transformed into multi-IDE platform (January 2025)
- üöÄ **Current Focus**: RStudio feature parity and shared infrastructure improvements

**Monorepo Structure:**
- `pkg/` - Shared AWS infrastructure library
- `apps/jupyter/` - Jupyter Lab launcher (feature complete)
- `apps/rstudio/` - RStudio Server launcher (basic implementation)

**Coverage Status:**
- pkg: Tests passing (aws package tested)
- apps/jupyter: 27.8% CLI, all tests passing
- apps/rstudio: No tests yet (needs development)

## üîÑ Versioning Strategy

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version when making incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when adding functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when making backward compatible bug fixes

**Special Considerations for Monorepo:**
- Version numbers apply to the entire project (all apps share version)
- Breaking changes in pkg/ trigger major version bump
- New IDE support triggers minor version bump
- Bug fixes in any app trigger patch version bump

---

## üìù Last Updated

- **Date:** January 2025
- **Version:** v0.5.0 (Monorepo Migration - In Progress)
- **Next Review:** February 2025
- **Project Status:** Transitioning from single app to multi-IDE platform
