# Lens Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for the Lens project. The project follows semantic versioning and is organized into phases.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Version Number Clarification

**Important**: Roadmap phase numbers (v0.7.0, v0.8.0, etc.) represent feature planning phases and may not match actual release version numbers due to development priorities and release timing.

**Current Status**:
- v0.8.0 release = Rebranding (AWS IDE ‚Üí Lens)
- v0.9.0 release = Completed v0.7.0 roadmap goals (User Experience)
- v0.10.0 planned = Will address v0.8.0 roadmap goals (Additional Tools)

We maintain flexibility to ship features when ready, not strictly by roadmap order.

**üìñ See Also**: `docs/TOOL_SUPPORT_STRATEGY.md` - Tool Priority Tier 2

### Goals
Support high-demand commercial research tools that use modern cloud authentication (user logs in with credentials - simple!).

### Why This Is Easy
Modern commercial tools handle licensing via cloud authentication:
1. Install software on AMI
2. Launch via DCV desktop
3. User logs in with institutional/vendor credentials
4. Software validates license automatically

**No license configuration system needed!** Just DCV + installed software.

### Applications

  - [ ] `environmental` - Environmental analysis
  - [ ] `remote-sensing` - Satellite imagery analysis

**lens-geneious** üéØ MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] Geneious Prime for bioinformatics
- [ ] Cloud authentication (Geneious account)
- [ ] Environments:
  - [ ] `genomics` - DNA/RNA sequence analysis
  - [ ] `molecular-biology` - General molecular biology

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ 3-4 major cloud-authenticated commercial tools working

- [ ] MeshLab (via lens-tool catalog, open source)

**Remote Sensing**
- [ ] ENVI/IDL (via lens-tool catalog, BYOL)
- [ ] SNAP (ESA) (via lens-tool catalog, open source)

### Tool Catalog System
- [ ] Universal `lens-tool` launcher for long-tail tools
- [ ] Community AMI contributions
- [ ] Tool discovery: `lens tools search bioinformatics`
- [ ] Tool info: `lens tools info geneious`

### Infrastructure Needed
- [ ] License file upload and storage system
- [ ] License server configuration
- [ ] Pre-launch license validation (optional)

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Legacy license tools (Stata, SPSS) working
- ‚úÖ License file configuration documented for IT admins
- ‚úÖ Tool catalog system operational for long-tail tools
- ‚úÖ Community can contribute tool definitions
- ‚úÖ Clear separation: cloud-auth tools (easy) vs legacy (complex)

## üîÑ Versioning Strategy

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version when making incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when adding functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when making backward compatible bug fixes

**Special Considerations for Monorepo:**
- Version numbers apply to the entire project (all apps share version)
- Breaking changes in pkg/ trigger major version bump
- New IDE support triggers minor version bump
- Bug fixes in any app trigger patch version bump
