## 🔄 Versioning Strategy

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version when making incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when adding functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when making backward compatible bug fixes

**Special Considerations for Monorepo:**
- Version numbers apply to the entire project (all apps share version)
- Breaking changes in pkg/ trigger major version bump
- New IDE support triggers minor version bump
- Bug fixes in any app trigger patch version bump
