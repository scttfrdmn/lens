# Package Manager Migration Guide

## Repository Migration: aws-jupyter â†’ aws-ide

The aws-jupyter project has been transformed into the **AWS IDE monorepo** (`scttfrdmn/aws-ide`). This document provides guidance for updating existing package manager submissions.

### ðŸŽ¯ What Changed

- **Repository URL:** `github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-jupyter` â†’ `github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-ide`
- **Release URLs:** All release artifacts now come from aws-ide repository
- **Binary location:** No change - `aws-jupyter` and `aws-jupyter.exe` remain the same
- **Functionality:** 100% backward compatible - no breaking changes

### ðŸ“¦ Existing Package Manager PRs

#### 1. Scoop (ScoopInstaller/Main)

**PR Link:** https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/pull/7267

**Status:** Needs update for monorepo

**Required Changes:**

            "64bit": {
                "url": "https://github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-ide/releases/download/v$version/aws-jupyter_Windows_x86_64.zip"
            },
            "arm64": {
                "url": "https://github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-ide/releases/download/v$version/aws-jupyter_Windows_arm64.zip"
            }
        },
        "hash": {
            "url": "$baseurl/checksums.txt"
        }
    }
}
```

**Action Items:**
1. Wait for v0.5.0 release to complete and artifacts to be published
2. Get SHA256 hashes from: https://github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-ide/releases/download/v0.5.0/checksums.txt
3. Update PR #7267 with new manifest or
4. Close old PR and submit fresh one with updated manifest

**Comment for PR Update:**

## Update: Repository Migration

The aws-jupyter project has been migrated to a monorepo structure at
https://github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-ide.

**Changes in this update:**
- Updated repository URLs to point to aws-ide
- Updated to v0.5.0 (monorepo release)
- No functional changes to the binary
- Autoupdate will continue to work with new repository

The aws-jupyter binary remains functionally identical and 100% backward compatible.
```

#### 2. Conda-forge (conda-forge/staged-recipes)

**PR Link:** https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/31241

**Status:** Needs update for monorepo

**Required Changes:**

The conda-forge recipe needs to be updated to point to the new repository. Here's what needs to change in `recipes/aws-jupyter/meta.yaml`:

```yaml
{% set name = "aws-jupyter" %}
{% set version = "0.5.0" %}

package:
  name: {{ name|lower }}
  version: {{ version }}

source:
  url: https://github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-ide/archive/refs/tags/v{{ version }}.tar.gz
  sha256: <hash of source tarball>

build:
  number: 0
  script:
    - cd apps/jupyter  # NEW: Navigate to jupyter app directory
    - go build -v -o $PREFIX/bin/{{ name }} ./cmd/aws-jupyter  # Updated path

requirements:
  build:
    - {{ compiler('go-cgo') }}
    - go >=1.22
  run:
    - aws-cli

test:
  commands:
    - aws-jupyter --version

## Update: Repository Migration

The aws-jupyter project has been migrated to a monorepo structure at
https://github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-ide.

**Changes in this update:**
- Updated repository URLs to point to aws-ide
- Updated build script to navigate to `apps/jupyter/` directory
- Updated to v0.5.0 (monorepo release)
- Updated all documentation links
- No functional changes to the binary

The aws-jupyter binary remains functionally identical and 100% backward compatible.
The monorepo structure allows sharing infrastructure with other AWS IDE tools like aws-rstudio.
```

### ðŸ”„ Automated Updates

Both package managers have autoupdate mechanisms:

**Scoop:** The `autoupdate` section will automatically generate PRs for future releases using the aws-ide repository URLs.

**Conda-forge:** Once the feedstock is created, the regro-cf-autotick-bot will automatically create PRs for new releases. The feedstock's `recipe/meta.yaml` will need the updated URLs.

### âš¡ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Wait for v0.5.0 GitHub release to complete
- [ ] Download checksums.txt from v0.5.0 release
- [ ] Update Scoop PR #7267 with new manifest
- [ ] Calculate source tarball SHA256 for conda
- [ ] Update Conda PR #31241 with new recipe
- [ ] Verify both PRs reference aws-ide repository
- [ ] Test installations after PRs are merged

### ðŸŽ‰ Benefits of Migration

The monorepo structure provides:
- Shared infrastructure for multiple IDE tools (Jupyter, RStudio, etc.)
- Consistent release management across all tools
- Unified documentation and contribution process
- Better code reuse and maintenance

Users of aws-jupyter will see no changes - the tool works exactly as before!
