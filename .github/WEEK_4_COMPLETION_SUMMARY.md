### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Critical Bug (Issue #7)

**Discovery**: Found critical bug where state changes were never recorded during instance lifecycle operations (start/stop/terminate).

**Impact**: Blocked all cost tracking features in v0.11.0. Without state change timestamps, accurate usage/billing calculations were impossible.

**Remediation**:
- Fixed in 6 files (3 shared CLI + 3 app-specific launch)
- Added 4 comprehensive unit tests
- Released as hotfix v0.7.3
- Documented in `.github/HOTFIX_ISSUE_7.md`
- Time to resolution: 2 hours

**Files Modified:**
```
pkg/cli/start.go              - Added RecordStateChange("running")
pkg/cli/stop.go               - Added RecordStateChange("stopped")
pkg/cli/terminate.go          - Added RecordStateChange("terminated")
apps/jupyter/internal/cli/launch.go  - Added RecordStateChange("running")
apps/rstudio/internal/cli/launch.go  - Added RecordStateChange("running")
apps/vscode/internal/cli/launch.go   - Added RecordStateChange("running")
pkg/config/state_test.go      - Added 4 test functions
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Created Lens Rebranding Issue (Issue #8)

**Decision**: Rename project from "Lens" to "Lens" (lenside.io domain)

**Binary Naming Convention**: `lens-jupyter`, `lens-rstudio`, `lens-vscode`, etc.
- ‚ùå Rejected: `ide-*` (too generic)
- ‚úÖ Adopted: `lens-*` (stronger branding)

**Updated All Issue Specifications**:
- All 30+ issues updated with lens-* naming
- `.github/GITHUB_ISSUES_SUMMARY.md` updated (10,000 lines)
- Consistent naming across all documentation

**Pending Decisions**:
- Config directory: `~/.lens/` vs `~/.lens-jupyter/`
- Go module path: `github.com/scttfrdmn/lens` (recommended)
- Repository rename: `lens` ‚Üí `lens` (confirmed)

### 4. ‚úÖ Configured GitHub Project Board

**Project**: Lens Development (Project #6)
**URL**: https://github.com/users/scttfrdmn/projects/6

**Custom Fields Created** (via GraphQL API):

1. **Persona** (Single Select)
   - Solo Researcher, Graduate Student, Lab PI, Course Instructor, Research Computing Manager

2. **Phase** (Single Select)
   - v0.7.0 through v1.0.0, Backlog

3. **Estimate** (Number)
   - Story points or hour estimates

4. **ROI** (Single Select)
   - High, Medium, Low

**Project Items Added**:
- 30 open issues
- 1 closed issue (#7)
- **Total: 31 items**

**Documentation Created**:
- `.github/PROJECT_BOARD_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide including:
  - Custom field descriptions
  - 5 recommended views (Kanban, By Phase, By Persona, Current Sprint, Backlog)
  - Manual view setup instructions
  - Workflow guidelines
  - Traceability documentation

**Note**: Views must be created manually through GitHub UI due to API limitations.

### 5. ‚úÖ Maintained Traceability

All issues maintain 5-layer traceability:

```
Personas ‚Üí Scenarios ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Issues ‚Üí Pull Requests
```

**Example Traceability Chain**:
```
Persona: Graduate Student
  ‚Üì
Scenario: "Need to reproduce analysis for paper submission"
  ‚Üì
Requirements: REQ-9.1 (Reproducibility), REQ-4.3 (Export)
  ‚Üì
Issues: #12 (Conda support), #25 (Export/import)
  ‚Üì
PRs: [Will be created during implementation]
```

**Documentation Supporting Traceability**:
- `.github/personas/*.md` (5 persona walkthroughs)
- `USER_REQUIREMENTS.md` (142 requirements)
- `ROADMAP.md` (6-phase development plan)
- `.github/GITHUB_ISSUES_SUMMARY.md` (Issue specifications)
