# Lens

A powerful CLI toolkit for launching secure cloud-based development environments on AWS EC2 with professional-grade networking and security features.

## Overview

Lens is a monorepo containing multiple CLI tools for managing different cloud-based IDEs on AWS:

- **[lens-jupyter](apps/jupyter/)** - Launch and manage Jupyter Lab instances
- **[lens-rstudio](apps/rstudio/)** - Launch and manage RStudio Server instances
- **[lens-vscode](apps/vscode/)** - Launch and manage VSCode Server (code-server) instances

## Key Features

### üîí Security & Access Control
- **Session Manager**: Secure access without SSH keys or bastion hosts
- **SSM-based Readiness Polling**: Health checks from inside instances without exposed ports
- **Traditional SSH**: Full SSH key management with economical reuse strategy
- **Private Subnets**: Enterprise-grade isolation with optional NAT Gateway
- **Smart Security Groups**: Automatic firewall rules with IP restrictions

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Management
- **Zero Infrastructure**: Deploy from your laptop with full AWS integration
- **Graviton Optimized**: ARM64 instances for best price/performance ratio
- **Advanced Networking**: Public/private subnet support with NAT Gateway creation
- **Resource Reuse**: Smart reuse of existing infrastructure to minimize costs

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment System
- **Built-in Environments**: Pre-configured environments for different use cases
- **Auto-Generation**: Create custom environments from your local setup
- **YAML Configuration**: Simple, version-controlled environment definitions
- **Package Management**: Automatic handling of system packages and dependencies

### üí∞ Cost Optimization
- **Automatic Idle Detection**: Multi-signal monitoring (kernels, CPU, processes)
- **Auto-Stop**: Configurable idle timeout to prevent runaway costs
- **Flexible Timeouts**: Set custom idle timeouts (e.g., `--idle-timeout 30m`, `2h`, `8h`)
- **Smart Monitoring**: Detects active sessions, CPU usage, and running computations
- **Cost Tracking**: Built-in cost analysis showing effective cost per hour with stop/start savings
- **Monthly Estimates**: Project costs based on actual usage patterns

### üîß Configuration & Management
- **Unified Config**: Single config file (`~/.lens/config.yaml`) shared across all tools
- **Flexible Settings**: Configure defaults for region, instance type, networking, and more
- **Cost Alerts**: Set monthly cost thresholds with automatic warnings
- **Per-Tool Overrides**: App-specific settings for Jupyter, RStudio, and VSCode

sudo rpm -i lens-rstudio_0.6.2_linux_amd64.rpm
sudo rpm -i lens-vscode_0.6.2_linux_amd64.rpm
```

### Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/scttfrdmn/lens
cd lens

# Build Jupyter launcher
cd apps/jupyter
go build -o lens-jupyter ./cmd/lens-jupyter
sudo mv lens-jupyter /usr/local/bin/

# Build RStudio launcher
cd ../rstudio
go build -o lens-rstudio ./cmd/lens-rstudio
sudo mv lens-rstudio /usr/local/bin/

# Build VSCode launcher
cd ../vscode
go build -o lens-vscode ./cmd/lens-vscode
sudo mv lens-vscode /usr/local/bin/
```

### Launch Your First Instance

```bash
# Launch Jupyter Lab with all defaults
lens-jupyter launch

# Launch RStudio Server
lens-rstudio launch

# Launch VSCode Server
lens-vscode launch

# Launch with Session Manager (no SSH)
lens-jupyter launch --connection session-manager

# Launch with custom timeout
lens-jupyter launch --idle-timeout 2h
```

### Configuration Management

All three tools share a unified configuration system:

```bash
# Initialize config file with defaults
lens-jupyter config init

# View current configuration
lens-jupyter config show

# Set defaults
lens-jupyter config set default_region us-west-2
lens-jupyter config set default_instance_type t4g.large
lens-rstudio config set default_ebs_size 50

# Enable cost tracking
lens-vscode config set enable_cost_tracking true
lens-vscode config set cost_alert_threshold 100

# App-specific settings
lens-vscode config set vscode.port 8080
```

Configuration is stored in `~/.lens/config.yaml` and shared across all tools.

### Cost Tracking

Monitor and optimize your cloud spending:

```bash
# View costs for all instances
lens-jupyter costs

# Detailed breakdown for specific instance
lens-jupyter costs i-1234567890abcdef0

# Show detailed breakdowns for all instances
lens-rstudio costs --details
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Effective Cost**: Total cost / elapsed hours (shows true savings from stop/start)
- **Utilization**: Percentage of time instance was actually running
- **Monthly Estimate**: Projected monthly cost based on current usage pattern
- **24/7 Comparison**: How much you save vs running continuously

Example output:
```
Instance: i-abc123 (data-science)
  Type: t4g.large
  Running: 12.5h / 48.0h (26% utilization)
  Total Cost: $1.23
  Effective Rate: $0.026/hour

  Savings vs 24/7: $0.073/hour (74%)
```

## How It Works: SSM-Based Readiness Polling

Lens uses AWS Systems Manager (SSM) for secure, agentless service health checks during instance launch:

**The Problem**: Traditional health checks require exposing service ports through security groups, creating security risks and complexity.

**The Solution**: SSM-based polling checks service health from **inside** the instance using AWS Systems Manager:

1. Launch instance with IAM instance profile (SSM access included)
2. Wait for SSM agent to come online (typically 5-10 seconds)
3. Execute `curl localhost:<port>` commands via SSM to check service readiness
4. Display real-time progress with cloud-init logs streamed via SSH
5. Report when service is ready (typically 2-3 minutes total)

**Benefits**:
- Works regardless of security group configuration
- No need to expose service ports externally for testing
- More secure launch process with reduced attack surface
- Unified health checking across all IDE types (VSCode, Jupyter, RStudio)
- Real-time progress visibility with concurrent progress streaming

All three apps (lens-jupyter, lens-rstudio, lens-vscode) use this approach by default.

## AWS Authentication

Before using any Lens tools, configure AWS credentials:

```bash
# Option 1: AWS CLI (Recommended)
aws configure

# Option 2: Environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

# Option 3: AWS profiles
aws configure --profile myprofile
lens-jupyter launch --profile myprofile
```

See the [Jupyter AWS Authentication Guide](apps/jupyter/docs/AWS_AUTHENTICATION.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Versioning
