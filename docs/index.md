# AWS IDE Documentation

Welcome to AWS IDE - a suite of command-line tools for launching secure, cloud-based development environments for academic research on AWS.

## What is AWS IDE?

AWS IDE provides three powerful applications for researchers:

- **[aws-jupyter](user-guides/jupyter.md)**: Launch Jupyter Lab instances for data science and machine learning
- **[aws-rstudio](user-guides/rstudio.md)**: Launch RStudio Server for statistical computing and R development  
- **[aws-vscode](user-guides/vscode.md)**: Launch VSCode Server for general-purpose development

All tools share robust infrastructure for AWS integration, security, cost optimization, and ease of use.
