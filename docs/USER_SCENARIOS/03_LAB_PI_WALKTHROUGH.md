# Lab PI Walkthrough: Prof. James Chen

> **Persona**: Physics lab Principal Investigator managing 5 PhD students + 2 postdocs
> **Technical Level**: 4/5 (Strong computational background, but limited time for infrastructure)
> **Budget**: $15,000/year AWS budget across entire lab from NSF grant
> **Primary Pain Point**: Managing 7 researchers' cloud spending, preventing cost overruns, ensuring reproducibility

---

## Profile

**Name**: Prof. James Chen
**Position**: Associate Professor, Computational Physics
**Institution**: R1 research university (top-tier research institution)
**Research Focus**: Computational astrophysics (supernova simulations, gravitational waves)
**Age**: 42
**Location**: Berkeley, California (uses us-west-2)

### Leadership Context
**Lab composition**:
- 5 PhD students (years 1-5)
- 2 postdoctoral researchers
- 1 undergraduate research assistant (part-time)
- **Total**: 7-8 researchers with varying technical skills

**Technical skill distribution**:
- 2 students: Highly technical (can manage AWS manually)
- 3 students: Moderate (comfortable with Python, need guidance on cloud)
- 2 students: Beginners (struggle with command line, intimidated by cloud)
- 2 postdocs: Expert (but busy, want tools to "just work")

### Budget & Grant Context
**NSF Grant**: $500,000 over 3 years
- Personnel: $350,000 (salaries, benefits)
- Equipment: $50,000 (workstations, storage)
- **Cloud computing**: $45,000 ($15,000/year)
- Travel: $30,000
- Other: $25,000

**Budget allocation philosophy**:
- Each student: ~$2,000/year compute budget
- Postdocs: ~$2,500/year (more productive)
- Prof. Chen's discretionary: $3,000/year (emergency overflow)

**Grant reporting requirements**:
- Quarterly progress reports to NSF program officer
- Annual budget justifications (must show cloud spending was necessary)
- Must demonstrate cost-effective use of taxpayer funds

### Time Constraints
**Prof. Chen's weekly schedule**:
- Teaching: 10 hours (2 courses)
- Meetings: 15 hours (students, faculty, admin)
- Research: 10 hours (personal research, paper writing)
- Grant writing: 5 hours
- Service: 5 hours (committees, reviews)
- **Available for infrastructure**: ~2 hours/week (wants less)

**Pain point**: No time to be IT support for 7 researchers

---

## Current Situation (Before AWS IDE)

### Existing Lab Infrastructure

**Lab server** ("the beast"):
- 2× NVIDIA A100 GPUs (purchased 2 years ago, $20,000)
- 128GB RAM, 32 cores
- Shared NFS storage (50TB)
- Administered by Prof. Chen personally (no IT staff)

**Problems with lab server**:
1. **Single point of failure**: Hardware failure = entire lab blocked for 2 weeks (waiting for replacement parts)
2. **Scheduling hell**: 7 researchers sharing 2 GPUs = constant Slack negotiations
3. **No isolation**: One student's buggy code crashes server → affects everyone
4. **Maintenance burden**: Prof. Chen spends 5+ hours/month on sysadmin tasks
5. **No scalability**: Can't add GPUs for short-term projects (hardware procurement takes months)

### Previous AWS Experiences (2023-2024)

**Incident 1: The $4,000 Mistake** (April 2023)
- 1st-year PhD student (David) exploring AWS for first project
- Launched 5× p3.8xlarge instances (8 GPUs each)
- Intended: Run for 2 hours ($40)
- Actual: Forgot to terminate, ran for 13 days ($4,100)
- Discovery: Prof. Chen received AWS bill 2 weeks later
- **Impact**: Had to request supplemental funding from department chair (embarrassing)

**Response**: Prof. Chen created "AWS usage policy" (5-page document)
- Pre-approval required for any AWS usage
- Must submit cost estimate
- Must report back within 24 hours
- **Result**: Students stopped using AWS (too much friction)

**Incident 2: The Reproducibility Crisis** (September 2023)
- Postdoc published paper with ML model for gravitational wave detection
- Reviewer: "Can you share your training environment?"
- Postdoc: "I used an EC2 instance... I think it was Ubuntu 20.04? I installed packages manually..."
- Reviewer: "Results don't reproduce - different PyTorch version gives different results"
- Paper revision took 3 additional months
- **Impact**: Missed conference deadline, paper delayed

**Incident 3: The Heterogeneity Problem** (Ongoing)
- 7 researchers using 7 different setups:
  - 2 using lab server
  - 1 using AWS EC2 (manually configured)
  - 1 using Google Colab
  - 2 using personal laptops
  - 1 using university HPC cluster (6-week queue times)
- **Problems**:
  - Can't share code/environments reliably
  - Prof. Chen can't verify anyone's results
  - Reproducibility nightmare
  - Collaboration difficult

### Pain Points Summary

| Pain Point | Impact | Annual Cost (Time or Money) |
|-----------|--------|----------------------------|
| AWS cost overruns | Budget stress, embarrassment | $4,000 mistake + admin overhead |
| Heterogeneous setups | Reproducibility issues, collaboration friction | 40 hours/year troubleshooting |
| Lab server scheduling | Student conflicts, blocked research | 2-3 hours/week Slack coordination |
| Infrastructure management | Prof. Chen's time wasted on sysadmin | 5 hours/month = 60 hours/year |
| No cost visibility | Can't track spending per student/project | Unknown until bill arrives |
| Grant reporting burden | Manual spreadsheet compilation | 20 hours/year |

**Total impact**:
- **Money**: $4,000 overspent (27% of annual cloud budget wasted)
- **Time**: 100+ hours/year managing infrastructure (Prof. Chen's time)
- **Research**: Multiple delays due to reproducibility/infrastructure issues
- **Morale**: Student conflicts over shared resources

## AWS IDE Workflow

### Lab-Wide Deployment Strategy

**Week 1: Evaluation** (Prof. Chen tries it personally)

Prof. Chen hears about AWS IDE at a conference. Decides to evaluate before rolling out to students.

#### Personal Trial (Tuesday Morning)

```bash
# Prof. Chen on his MacBook
brew install scttfrdmn/tap/aws-jupyter

# Launch wizard
aws-jupyter
```

**Wizard experience**:
```
🚀 Welcome to AWS Jupyter!

❓ What type of analysis do you want to do?
  1) Data science
  2) Statistical analysis
  3) Machine learning / Deep learning
  4) Bioinformatics
  5) Scientific computing (HPC-style)  ← Prof. Chen selects
  6) Other

Your choice: 5

❓ How much compute power do you need?
  1) Light (2-4 CPUs, 8GB RAM)
  2) Medium (4-8 CPUs, 16-32GB RAM)  ← Prof. Chen selects
  3) Heavy (16+ CPUs, 64+ GB RAM)
  4) GPU

Your choice: 2

I recommend: c6g.2xlarge
  - 8 CPUs (ARM64 Graviton), 16 GB RAM
  - Optimized for compute-intensive workloads
  - $0.272/hour = $6.53/day (24/7) = $196/month (24/7)
  - With auto-stop (4h/day): ~$33/month

💰 Cost Estimate:
   Hourly: $0.272/hr
   Your typical session (4 hours): $1.09
   With auto-stop: ~$33/month

❓ Ready to launch?
Your choice: y
```

**3 minutes later**:

```
✓ Your environment is ready!
🌐 Jupyter Lab: http://54.186.132.45:8888
```

**Prof. Chen's test** (30 minutes):
- Uploads simulation script (Fortran + Python wrapper)
- Runs test simulation (1 hour)
- Checks results
- Stops instance: `aws-jupyter stop`

**Cost**: $0.27

**Prof. Chen's assessment**: ✅ "This is simple enough for my students. The auto-stop addresses my biggest fear. Let's roll it out."

---

### Week 2: Lab Onboarding

#### Lab Meeting (Monday, 2 PM)

**Prof. Chen announces**:
> "We're moving to AWS IDE for cloud computing. I've been managing our cloud spending ineffectively, and the lab server is a bottleneck. AWS IDE has auto-stop built-in, so we won't have cost overruns like last year's $4,000 incident. I want everyone set up by end of week."

**Student reactions**:
- **Advanced students (2)**: "Will we have full AWS access? Can we customize?"
- **Moderate students (3)**: "Is it hard to set up?"
- **Beginner students (2)**: "I don't know how to use AWS..."

**Prof. Chen's responses**:
- Advanced: "You can use CLI flags to customize. Wizard is optional (`--no-wizard`)."
- Moderate: "Wizard guides you through setup. Takes 15 minutes."
- Beginners: "That's exactly why I chose this - plain English interface, no AWS knowledge needed."

#### Group Setup Session (Wednesday, 3-5 PM)

Prof. Chen holds 2-hour "setup office hours" - all students come with laptops.

**Results**:
- 7/7 students successfully installed AWS IDE
- 7/7 students launched first instance successfully
- Average time to first working instance: 18 minutes
- 2 students had AWS credential issues (resolved in 10 minutes with Prof. Chen's help)

**Student feedback**:
- Advanced students: "This is actually pretty nice. Wizard is fast, but I can skip it."
- Moderate students: "Way easier than I expected! The wizard explained everything."
- Beginner students: "I thought I'd struggle, but I got it working! The cost preview helped me understand what I'm spending."

---

### Week 3-4: Establishing Lab Norms

#### Creating Lab Configuration Guide

Prof. Chen creates `.github` documentation repo for lab with:

**File**: `cloud-computing-guidelines.md`

```markdown
# Chen Lab Cloud Computing Guidelines

## Quick Start
Install: `brew install aws-jupyter aws-rstudio` (choose based on your language preference)

## Standard Configurations

### For typical simulation work:
- Instance: c6g.2xlarge (8 CPUs, 16GB RAM) - $0.272/hr
- Launch: `aws-jupyter launch --instance-type c6g.2xlarge --idle-timeout 2h`
- Max cost per session: ~$1.50

### For GPU/deep learning work:
- Instance: g4dn.xlarge (1 GPU, 4 CPUs, 16GB RAM) - $0.526/hr
- Must get Prof. Chen approval for >4 hour runs
- Launch: `aws-jupyter launch --instance-type g4dn.xlarge --env deep-learning-gpu`

## Lab Rules

1. **ALWAYS use auto-stop** (default 2-hour timeout)
2. **Check costs weekly**: `aws-jupyter costs`
3. **Stop when done**: `aws-jupyter stop` (don't rely solely on auto-stop)
4. **Export environments for papers**: `aws-jupyter env export` before submission
5. **Report to Prof. Chen monthly**: Send cost summary (first Friday of month)

## Monthly Budget Allocations

- PhD students: $150/month recommended limit
- Postdocs: $200/month recommended limit
- If you need more: Talk to Prof. Chen with justification

## Questions?
- Slack: #lab-computing channel
- Office hours: Fridays 2-3 PM
```

#### Monthly Cost Reporting System

Prof. Chen creates Google Sheet: "Lab Cloud Spending Tracker"

**Format**:

| Student | Month | Sessions | Total Hours | Cost | % of Budget | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------|------|-------------|-------|
| Alex | Jan | 12 | 68h | $18.50 | 12% | Normal usage |
| David | Jan | 8 | 42h | $11.42 | 8% | Lower usage (on-site experiments) |
| Emma | Jan | 15 | 89h | $24.25 | 16% | ML experiments |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Process**:
- 1st Friday of month: Students run `aws-jupyter costs --last-month` and submit to spreadsheet
- Prof. Chen reviews in 15 minutes (vs 2 hours manually compiling AWS Cost Explorer data)
- Flags students exceeding budget for discussion

---

## Managing Lab Spending: Month 3 Snapshot

### February Cost Report (All 7 Researchers)

```bash
# Prof. Chen runs aggregated command (future feature):
# For now, Prof. Chen manually collects from each student
```

**February spending** (compiled from 7 students):

| Researcher | Role | Sessions | Hours | Cost | Budget % | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Alex | PhD-3 | 16 | 89h | $24.22 | 16% | GPU usage (thesis work) |
| David | PhD-1 | 8 | 38h | $10.34 | 7% | Learning phase |
| Emma | PhD-4 | 18 | 102h | $27.74 | 18% | Paper deadline push |
| Fiona | PhD-2 | 10 | 54h | $14.69 | 10% | Normal usage |
| George | PhD-5 | 20 | 115h | $31.28 | 21% | Dissertation simulations |
| Hannah | Postdoc | 22 | 128h | $34.82 | 17% | Active research |
| Ian | Postdoc | 25 | 145h | $39.44 | 20% | Grant proposal sims |
| **TOTAL** | - | **119** | **671h** | **$182.53** | **14%** | Well under budget |

**Analysis**:

**Budget performance**:
- Monthly budget: $1,250 ($15,000/year ÷ 12)
- Actual spending: $182.53
- Under budget: $1,067.47 (85% savings!)
- **Conclusion**: Lab using only 15% of allocated budget

**Utilization insights**:
- Most active: Ian (postdoc, 145 hours)
- Least active: David (PhD-1, still learning)
- Average per researcher: 96 hours/month
- Average cost per researcher: $26/month

**Prof. Chen's reaction**:
> "This is fantastic. We're spending $183/month vs the $1,250 budgeted. That's $1,000/month saved = $12,000/year. I can reallocate those savings to conference travel or extending a postdoc position. And I can see exactly who's using what - this visibility alone is worth it."

## Pain Points & Solutions

### Pain #1: Cost Overruns and Budget Panic

**Before AWS IDE** (April 2023 incident):
- Student launched 5× p3.8xlarge instances
- Forgot to terminate for 13 days
- Cost: $4,100 (27% of annual budget)
- Prof. Chen discovered 2 weeks later (AWS bill delay)
- Had to request supplemental funding (embarrassing)
- Lost trust in cloud computing

**With AWS IDE**:
- Auto-stop enabled by default (2-hour timeout)
- Even if student forgets, max cost: 2 hours × $0.272 = $0.54
- Worst case (student launches p3.8xlarge and forgets):
  - Old way: 13 days × 24 hours × $12.24/hr = $3,818
  - AWS IDE: 2 hours × $12.24/hr = $24.48
  - **98% reduction in mistake damage**

**Real AWS IDE experience** (Month 2):
- Student Emma launched g4dn.xlarge ($0.526/hr)
- Started training run, went to dinner and movie (forgot about it)
- Auto-stop triggered after 2 hours idle
- Cost: $1.05 (vs $252 if ran for 3 days until Emma remembered)

**Success Metric**:
- ✅ Zero cost overruns in 6 months (vs 1 major incident/year before)
- ✅ 98% reduction in "forgot to stop" damage ($4,100 → $24 max)
- ✅ Prof. Chen sleeps soundly (no anxiety about surprise bills)
- ✅ Trust restored: Students can use cloud without pre-approval

**Related GitHub Issues**: #19 (Budget alerts), #20 (Email notifications before auto-stop)
**Related Requirements**: REQ-2.2 (Auto-Stop by Default), REQ-2.3 (Budget Tracking)

---

### Pain #2: Infrastructure Management Burden

**Before AWS IDE**:
- Prof. Chen spent 5 hours/month on lab server maintenance:
  - Security patches (1 hour/month)
  - Broken package dependencies (2 hours/month)
  - Disk space management (1 hour/month)
  - User access management (0.5 hour/month)
  - Hardware troubleshooting (0.5 hour/month average, spikes to 20 hours when GPU fails)
- Total: 60 hours/year + 20 hours/year crisis management = **80 hours/year**

**With AWS IDE**:
- AWS manages hardware, OS, security patches
- Students manage their own instances
- Prof. Chen's role: Set guidelines, review monthly costs
- Time spent: 1 hour/month (12 hours/year)
- **Time saved**: 68 hours/year (85% reduction)

**ROI calculation**:
- Prof. Chen's time value: ~$100/hour (academic rate)
- Time saved: 68 hours/year
- **Value created**: $6,800/year
- AWS cost increase: $2,200/year ($15,000 budget - $2,200 actual spending = still under budget)
- **Net value**: $6,800 - $2,200 = $4,600/year positive ROI

**Success Metric**:
- ✅ 85% reduction in Prof. Chen's infrastructure time (80 → 12 hours/year)
- ✅ Zero hardware procurement/maintenance
- ✅ Students self-sufficient (don't need Prof. Chen for troubleshooting)
- ✅ $4,600/year net positive ROI

**Related Requirements**: REQ-5.2 (Lab-Wide Configuration Templates)

---

### Pain #3: Reproducibility and Collaboration

**Before AWS IDE** (September 2023 paper revision):
- Postdoc Hannah published paper
- Reviewer: "Can you share training environment?"
- Hannah: "I manually installed packages on EC2... I think Python 3.9? PyTorch 1.12 maybe?"
- Reviewer: "Can't reproduce results"
- Hannah spent 20 hours trying to recreate environment
- Still couldn't reproduce exactly (different package versions)
- Paper delayed 3 months

**With AWS IDE**:

**Scenario 1: Paper Submission**

Hannah completes gravitational wave detection model:
```bash
# Export environment
aws-jupyter env export > gw-detector-2025.yaml

# Include in paper supplementary materials
```

**Environment file** (`gw-detector-2025.yaml`):
```yaml
name: gravitational-wave-detector
description: Environment for Chen et al. 2025 ApJ paper
created: 2025-02-15
packages:
  system:
    - build-essential
    - gfortran
    - libhdf5-dev
  python:
    version: "3.11.8"
    packages:
      - numpy==1.26.4
      - scipy==1.12.0
      - pytorch==2.2.0
      - gwpy==3.0.8  # Gravitational wave library
      - matplotlib==3.8.3
  jupyter_extensions:
    - jupyterlab-git==0.50.0
aws_ide_version: "0.7.2"
```

**Reviewer reproduces** (3 months later):
```bash
# Download environment file from paper supplements
wget https://.../ gw-detector-2025.yaml

# Launch identical environment
aws-jupyter launch --env gw-detector-2025.yaml
```

**Result**: Identical package versions → results reproduce perfectly → paper accepted

**Scenario 2: Lab Collaboration**

Student Alex develops new simulation optimization:
```bash
# Share with labmate Emma
aws-jupyter env export > alex-optim-sim.yaml

# Email or Slack to Emma
```

Emma imports and uses immediately:
```bash
aws-jupyter launch --env alex-optim-sim.yaml
```

Both researchers now have identical environments → collaboration seamless

**Success Metric**:
- ✅ 100% reproducibility (identical environments)
- ✅ Paper revision time reduced 95% (20 hours → 1 hour)
- ✅ Zero "works on my machine" problems within lab
- ✅ Reviewer satisfaction: 0 reproducibility complaints in 6 months (vs 3/year before)

**Related GitHub Issues**: #12 (Environment export/import), #14 (Community environment templates)
**Related Requirements**: REQ-4.1 (Environment Export/Import), REQ-4.3 (Domain Templates)

---

### Pain #4: Heterogeneous Lab Setup Chaos

**Before AWS IDE**:
- 7 researchers using 7 different approaches:
  1. Alex: AWS EC2 manual setup (Ubuntu 22.04, Python 3.10)
  2. David: Lab server (Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8)
  3. Emma: Google Colab (unknown environment, auto-managed)
  4. Fiona: Personal MacBook (macOS, Python 3.11)
  5. George: University HPC cluster (CentOS 7, Python 3.6 - ancient)
  6. Hannah: AWS EC2 manual setup (Amazon Linux 2, Python 3.9)
  7. Ian: Lab server (Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8)

**Problems**:
- Code sharing impossible (different Python versions, package conflicts)
- Prof. Chen can't verify anyone's results (can't recreate environments)
- Reproducibility nightmare
- Students waste time troubleshooting "it works on my machine" issues

**With AWS IDE**:
- All 7 researchers using AWS IDE
- Prof. Chen recommended: `aws-jupyter --env scientific-computing` as lab standard
- Everyone has identical base environment
- Students can still customize (add packages), but share same foundation

**Lab Standard Environment** (created by Prof. Chen):

```bash
# Prof. Chen creates lab template
cat > chen-lab-standard.yaml <<EOF
name: chen-lab-standard
description: Chen Lab standard computational astrophysics environment
packages:
  system:
    - gfortran
    - mpich  # MPI for parallel computing
    - hdf5-tools
  python:
    version: "3.11"
    packages:
      - numpy==1.26.4
      - scipy==1.12.0
      - astropy==6.0.0
      - h5py==3.10.0
      - matplotlib==3.8.3
      - jupyter==1.0.0
EOF

# Students use lab standard:
aws-jupyter launch --env chen-lab-standard.yaml
```

**Result**: 7 researchers now have standardized, reproducible environments

**Success Metric**:
- ✅ 100% lab standardization (vs 0% before)
- ✅ 90% reduction in "environment troubleshooting" time (40 hours/year → 4 hours/year)
- ✅ Code sharing seamless within lab
- ✅ Prof. Chen can verify any student's work (reproducible environments)

**Related GitHub Issues**: #13 (Domain-specific templates), #14 (Community environment sharing)
**Related Requirements**: REQ-4.3 (Domain-Specific Templates), REQ-5.2 (Lab Configuration Templates)

---

### Pain #5: Grant Reporting Burden

**Before AWS IDE**:
- NSF requires quarterly budget justifications
- Prof. Chen spent 20 hours/year compiling cloud spending reports:
  - Download AWS Cost Explorer CSV (30 minutes)
  - Filter by tags (student names) - most students didn't tag resources (1 hour)
  - Manually categorize spending (2 hours)
  - Create charts for NSF report (1 hour)
  - **Per report**: 4.5 hours × 4/year = 18 hours
  - Plus annual report: +2 hours
  - **Total**: 20 hours/year

**With AWS IDE**:
```bash
# Prof. Chen generates grant report
aws-jupyter costs --from 2025-01-01 --to 2025-03-31 --format pdf --all-users

# Output: chen-lab-q1-2025-report.pdf
```

**Report includes** (auto-generated):
- Total lab spending: $547.59
- Breakdown by researcher (7 entries)
- Breakdown by instance type
- Monthly trend chart
- Utilization analysis (hours running vs stopped)

**Time to generate**: 2 minutes (vs 4.5 hours manual compilation)

**Success Metric**:
- ✅ 98% time reduction (4.5 hours → 2 minutes per report)
- ✅ 20 hours/year saved (18 hours quarterly + 2 hours annual)
- ✅ NSF program officer satisfaction: "Best budget justification I've seen"
- ✅ Can generate reports on-demand (no waiting for AWS billing cycle)

**Related GitHub Issues**: #21 (Cost reporting for grants)
**Related Requirements**: REQ-2.4 (Cost Reporting for Grants)

---

### Pain #6: Lab Server Bottleneck

**Before AWS IDE**:
- Lab server: 2× A100 GPUs, shared among 7 researchers
- Scheduling via Slack: "Who needs GPU tonight?"
- Common scenario:
  - Alex schedules GPU for Tuesday 6 PM - 10 PM
  - Emma needs "quick test" at 7 PM
  - Emma kills Alex's job → argument
  - Prof. Chen mediates → 30 minutes wasted
- **Frequency**: 2-3 conflicts per week
- **Prof. Chen's time**: 1.5 hours/week = 78 hours/year mediating conflicts

**With AWS IDE**:
- Each researcher launches their own GPU instance when needed
- No scheduling conflicts (everyone has dedicated resources)
- Elastic: Can scale to 7× GPUs during busy periods (e.g., conference deadlines)

**Real example** (March 2025 - conference deadline week):
- 5 students need GPUs simultaneously (normally would be impossible with 2-GPU lab server)
- Each launches g4dn.xlarge ($0.526/hr)
- All 5 work in parallel for 8 hours
- Total cost: 5 students × 8 hours × $0.526/hr = $21.04
- **Result**: Paper deadlines met, zero conflicts, $21 cost

**Before AWS IDE**: Would have required 5 students to time-share 2 GPUs = 8 hours per student × 5 students ÷ 2 GPUs = 20 hours calendar time (likely missed deadline)

**Success Metric**:
- ✅ Zero scheduling conflicts (vs 2-3/week before)
- ✅ 78 hours/year saved (Prof. Chen's mediation time)
- ✅ Elastic scaling during high-demand periods
- ✅ Student satisfaction: No more Slack arguments

**Related GitHub Issues**: #28 (GPU support)
**Related Requirements**: REQ-7.3 (GPU Support)

## Success Metrics: 6 Months Later

### Cost Performance

| Month | Budget | Actual Spending | % Used | Savings |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------|---------|
| Jan | $1,250 | $165.42 | 13% | $1,084.58 |
| Feb | $1,250 | $182.53 | 15% | $1,067.47 |
| Mar | $1,250 | $214.89 | 17% | $1,035.11 |
| Apr | $1,250 | $198.73 | 16% | $1,051.27 |
| May | $1,250 | $187.25 | 15% | $1,062.75 |
| Jun | $1,250 | $205.18 | 16% | $1,044.82 |
| **6-Month Total** | **$7,500** | **$1,154** | **15%** | **$6,346** |

**Analysis**:
- Budgeted: $7,500
- Spent: $1,154
- Under budget: $6,346 (85% savings!)
- Average monthly spending: $192

**Prof. Chen's reaction**:
> "We budgeted $15,000/year for cloud computing. Six months in, we've spent $1,154 - we're on track for $2,308/year actual spending. That's $12,692 saved annually. I can use those savings to extend a postdoc position by 3 months, or send students to an extra conference. This is a game-changer for grant budget management."

### Time Savings (Prof. Chen's Perspective)

| Activity | Before (hours/year) | After (hours/year) | Savings |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| Lab server maintenance | 80 | 0 | 80 |
| Student infrastructure support | 60 | 10 | 50 |
| Cost overrun crisis management | 20 | 0 | 20 |
| Grant report compilation | 20 | 1 | 19 |
| Student conflict mediation | 78 | 0 | 78 |
| **TOTAL** | **258 hours/year** | **11 hours/year** | **247 hours/year** |

**ROI Analysis**:
- Prof. Chen's time saved: 247 hours/year
- Value @ $100/hour: $24,700/year
- AWS IDE cost: $2,308/year (actual spending)
- Lab server depreciation: $10,000/year (2 years remaining on hardware)
- **Net savings**: $24,700 - $2,308 + $10,000 = **$32,392/year**

### Research Productivity (Lab-Wide)

| Metric | Before AWS IDE | After AWS IDE (6 months) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Papers submitted | 8/year | 16/year (projected) | 2x more |
| Reproducibility complaints | 3/year | 0 | 100% elimination |
| Infrastructure-related delays | 12/year | 1/year | 92% reduction |

### Student Satisfaction

**Anonymous lab survey** (conducted Month 6):

**Question**: "How satisfied are you with lab computing resources?"

| Response | Before AWS IDE | After AWS IDE |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Very Satisfied | 14% (1/7) | 86% (6/7) |
| Satisfied | 29% (2/7) | 14% (1/7) |
| Neutral | 29% (2/7) | 0% (0/7) |
| Dissatisfied | 14% (1/7) | 0% (0/7) |
| Very Dissatisfied | 14% (1/7) | 0% (0/7) |

**Student quotes**:
- **Alex (PhD-3)**: "No more fighting over GPUs. I can run experiments when I need to, not when the lab server is free."
- **Emma (PhD-4)**: "The reproducibility is amazing. I shared my environment with a collaborator at another university - they reproduced my results perfectly on first try."
- **David (PhD-1)**: "As a first-year, I was intimidated by AWS. The wizard made it approachable. Now I use it weekly."

## Qualitative Impact: Prof. Chen's Perspective

### Quote (Month 6 Reflection)

> "AWS IDE transformed my lab's computing infrastructure. Six months ago, I was spending 5 hours/week on infrastructure issues - server maintenance, student conflicts, cost overruns, grant reporting. Now I spend maybe 1 hour/month reviewing cost reports. That's 247 hours/year back for actual research and advising.
>
> The financial impact is huge too. We budgeted $15,000/year for cloud computing, but we're on track to spend $2,300. That $12,700 savings let me extend Hannah's postdoc for 3 more months - she's finishing a major paper that will be high-impact.
>
> But the biggest win is reproducibility. We haven't had a single reviewer complaint about reproducibility in 6 months. Every paper submission now includes an environment YAML file in the supplementary materials. Reviewers love it. And within the lab, students can finally collaborate seamlessly - no more 'works on my machine' problems.
>
> The auto-stop feature alone was worth it. After David's $4,000 mistake last year, I was terrified of cloud computing. Auto-stop means that even if someone forgets, max damage is $1-2, not thousands. That peace of mind is priceless.
>
> I'm recommending AWS IDE to every PI I know. This is what academic cloud computing should be - simple, safe, cost-effective, and reproducible."

## Lab Policies Established

### Chen Lab Computing Guidelines (Final Version)

**Document**: Shared on lab website and onboarding docs

#### 1. Standard Environments

**For simulation/analysis work**:
```bash
aws-jupyter launch --env chen-lab-standard
# Cost: ~$0.27/hour (c6g.2xlarge)
```

**For GPU/ML work**:
```bash
aws-jupyter launch --instance-type g4dn.xlarge --env deep-learning-gpu
# Cost: ~$0.53/hour
# Approval required for >6 hour runs
```

#### 2. Budget Allocations

- PhD students: $150/month soft limit, $200/month hard limit
- Postdocs: $200/month soft limit, $250/month hard limit
- If you anticipate exceeding limit: Email Prof. Chen with justification before month-end

#### 3. Monthly Reporting

- 1st Friday of each month: Run `aws-jupyter costs --last-month`
- Submit to lab Google Sheet
- Prof. Chen reviews and provides feedback
- No judgment - just visibility

#### 4. Reproducibility Requirements

**For paper submissions**:
1. Export environment: `aws-jupyter env export > paper-env.yaml`
2. Include in supplementary materials
3. Test environment export works (have labmate try importing)

**For lab collaborations**:
- Share environments via lab Git repo (`chen-lab-environments/`)
- Document any customizations in README

#### 5. Cost Optimization Tips

- **Always use auto-stop** (default 2-hour timeout)
- **Stop when done**: Don't rely solely on auto-stop
- **Right-size instances**: Most work fits on c6g.2xlarge ($0.27/hr), not c6g.8xlarge ($1.09/hr)
- **Download results regularly**: Don't keep instances running just for storage

#### 6. Getting Help

- **Infrastructure questions**: Slack #lab-computing channel (students help each other)
- **Cost concerns**: Email Prof. Chen directly
- **AWS IDE bugs**: Report to GitHub, CC Prof. Chen
